Project to test hiding of sub-folder

Scenario: 
The actual content is located in sub-folder 01, but the url-adress should look like www.site.net/index.htm and not as www.site.net/01/index.htm
In folder 02 is a new version of content, and if we decide to activate the content in folder 02,
then by the base url  www.site.net should shonw content from foder 02, but do not show the fragment '02' in the url adress
